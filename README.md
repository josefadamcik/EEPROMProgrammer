# EEPROM programmer for Arduino and shift registers

WIP. 

Allows an EEPROM to be pogrammed or read through a serial interface.

Just connect via serial and help will be printed. Commands can be used to controll the programmer.

There is a [companion project - a CLI program written in C++ that allows user to use this programmer with Intel HEX files](https://github.com/josefadamcik/EEPromProgrammerClient).


Based on [schematic and code from Ben Eater](https://github.com/beneater/eeprom-programmer) licensed under MIT licence.
